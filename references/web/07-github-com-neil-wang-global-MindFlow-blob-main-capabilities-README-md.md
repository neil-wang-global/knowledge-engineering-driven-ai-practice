# MindFlow/capabilities/README.md at main · neil-wang-global/MindFlow · GitHub

capabilities

This file is a navigation aid for human readers. The runtime loads individual cap-{name}.md files on demand — it does not load this file for constraint purposes.

This directory stores Capability definitions used by Plan and Step.

Directory Structure
TEMPLATE.md — the formal template for capability definition files
cap-EXAMPLE-TEMPLATE.md — a worked example (not loaded by runtime)
cap-{name}.md — individual capability definitions (created as needed)
Current Status

The definition structure is ready (see TEMPLATE.md), but no individual capability definition files have been instantiated yet. Capabilities are currently referenced by label name in Step declarations (e.g. Capability: cap-research).

When a Step references a capability label that has a corresponding cap-{name}.md file, the runtime must read that file as part of the Step's constraint loading. When no file exists for the label, the Step proceeds with the label as a classification identifier only — constraint loading from capabilities/ is skipped for that Step.

Rules
a Step must declare exactly one Capability label
if a Step needs multiple capabilities, split it into multiple Steps
Capability labels should be stable across tasks for traceability
see TEMPLATE.md for the full authoring rules when creating a new capability definition
Skill Rule

Skill is not a top-level runtime object. A Capability may load a Skill, but:

Capability is not Skill
Skill is only an execution resource that provides tool-level functionality
Skill selection is made at runtime by the executing agent; it is not declared in Plan
Bootstrap

During bootstrap (before any cap-{name}.md files exist):

capability labels in Step declarations serve as classification identifiers only
constraint loading from capabilities/ is skipped for Steps whose label has no corresponding file
Capability Update records (cu-*.md) may still be created with Status: proposed; they will be applied once the target cap-{name}.md is created
the capability evolution mechanism fully activates once the first cap-{name}.md file is created via a Capability Update with Status: applied

Create the first cap-{name}.md file when:

a Capability Update record (cu-*.md) reaches Status: approved and its Target Capability File does not yet exist
or when you identify a recurring capability label across multiple tasks that would benefit from formal constraints
